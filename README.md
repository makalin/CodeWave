# CodeWave 🌊

**CodeWave** is a blazing-fast, AI-assisted low-level coding tool purpose-built for developers working directly with machine code, assembly (x86, ARM, RISC-V), and hardware-near systems. With zero dependency on bulky frontend frameworks like React or Tailwind, CodeWave is handcrafted for performance, clarity, and precision.

## Features

- ⚙️ **Zero-Bloat Architecture**: Built without React, Tailwind, or other heavyweight libraries. Lightweight, fast, and focused.
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Development**: Real-time suggestions, opcode documentation, and bug insights via the Grok 3 API.
- 🛠 **Low-Level Coding First**: Write and emulate machine code, inspect memory/registers, and visualize binary transformations.
- 🔧 **Emulator Sandbox**: Run x86, ARM, RISC-V code directly in-browser with minimal system overhead.
- 🖼 **Custom UI Engine**: Canvas and DOM-based minimal interface, built manually for optimal rendering.
- 💾 **Offline-First**: Uses IndexedDB to save sessions and snippets — no server required.
- 🔗 **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebRTC-powered peer-to-peer code sharing and debugging sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (no React), Custom CSS (no Tailwind), Canvas API, Web Components (optional)
- **Backend**: Rust (WASM assembler/emulator), WebAssembly modules (QEMU, Binutils, NASM), Pyodide (in-browser Python)
- **AI**: Grok 3 API (xAI) for smart code support
- **Data Storage**: IndexedDB
- **Visualization**: Custom D3.js-free implementations for rendering registers/memory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Git (to clone)
- Optional: Python or Rust for building advanced emulators locally

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makalin/CodeWave.git
cd CodeWave
````

Open `index.html` in your browser — no build step required.

### Optional: Local Development

```bash
# Optional only if you are modifying the assembler/emulator core
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Usage

* 📝 **Write**: Use the integrated low-level editor to write raw assembly/machine code.
* 🔄 **Compile & Run**: See opcode output and emulate it instantly.
* 🔍 **Debug**: Inspect registers, memory, and instruction flow in real-time.
* 📤 **Share**: Peer-to-peer sharing for collaboration and instruction set exploration.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add MIPS, SPARC, and PowerPC architecture support
* [ ] Integrate CLI interface for native environments
* [ ] Expand visual tools for microcontroller simulation
* [ ] Add waveform-based execution timeline UI (no D3)
