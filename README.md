# CodeWave 🌊

**CodeWave** is a blazing-fast, AI-assisted low-level coding tool purpose-built for developers working directly with machine code, assembly (x86, ARM, RISC-V), and hardware-near systems. With zero dependency on bulky frontend frameworks like React or Tailwind, CodeWave is handcrafted for performance, clarity, and precision.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main entry point
- `style.css` — UI styles (dark theme)
- `src/` — Frontend JavaScript modules
  - `core/` — Application core logic
  - `ui/` — Editor and UI components
  - `ai/` — Multi-provider AI integration
  - `assemblers/` — Assemblers for x86, ARM, RISC-V
  - `emulators/` — Emulators for x86, ARM, RISC-V
  - `storage/` — IndexedDB storage logic
  - `utils/` — Utility modules (EventBus, helpers)
- `wasm/` — Rust/WASM backend (planned for advanced emulation)
- `assets/` — Static assets (icons, images)
- `docs/` — Documentation
- `tests/` — Test scripts

## Features

- ⚙️ **Zero-Bloat Architecture**: Built without React, Tailwind, or other heavyweight libraries. Lightweight, fast, and focused.
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Development**: Real-time suggestions, opcode documentation, and bug insights via Grok 3, OpenAI, Claude, and more.
- 🛠 **Low-Level Coding First**: Write and emulate machine code, inspect memory/registers, and visualize binary transformations.
- 🔧 **Emulator Sandbox**: Run x86, ARM, RISC-V code directly in-browser with minimal system overhead.
- 🖼 **Custom UI Engine**: Monaco-based minimal interface, built for optimal rendering.
- 💾 **Offline-First**: Uses IndexedDB to save sessions and snippets — no server required.
- 🔗 **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebRTC-powered peer-to-peer code sharing and debugging sessions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, Monaco Editor, Custom CSS, Web Components (optional)
- **Backend**: Rust (WASM assembler/emulator), WebAssembly modules (planned), Pyodide (in-browser Python, planned)
- **AI**: Grok 3 API (xAI), OpenAI, Claude, local models (future)
- **Data Storage**: IndexedDB (Dexie)
- **Visualization**: Custom D3.js-free implementations for rendering registers/memory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Git (to clone)
- Optional: Python or Rust for building advanced emulators locally

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makalin/CodeWave.git
cd CodeWave
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser — no build step required for the frontend.

#### Optional: Build WASM Backend

```bash
cd wasm
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Usage

* 📝 **Write**: Use the integrated low-level editor to write raw assembly/machine code.
* 🔄 **Compile & Run**: See opcode output and emulate it instantly.
* 🔍 **Debug**: Inspect registers, memory, and instruction flow in real-time.
* 📤 **Share**: Peer-to-peer sharing for collaboration and instruction set exploration.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add MIPS, SPARC, and PowerPC architecture support
* [ ] Integrate CLI interface for native environments
* [ ] Expand visual tools for microcontroller simulation
* [ ] Add waveform-based execution timeline UI (no D3)

## Future Improvements

- **WASM-Accelerated Emulation**: Move all emulation/assembly to Rust/WASM for near-native speed
- **ARM & RISC-V Full Support**: Implement full assembler/emulator for ARM and RISC-V
- **Microcontroller/Embedded Support**: Simulate microcontrollers (AVR, PIC, STM32, etc.)
- **Advanced Debugger**: Breakpoints, watchpoints, call stack, and time-travel debugging
- **AI Model Plugins**: Plug in custom or local AI models (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- **Integrated Documentation**: Inline opcode docs, architecture references, and learning resources
- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party extensions for new architectures, visualizations, or AI tools
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional encrypted cloud backup for sessions/snippets
- **Mobile/Tablet UI**: Touch-optimized interface for tablets and phones
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance Profiling**: Visualize execution time, memory usage, and hot paths
- **Theming**: User-customizable themes and layouts
